# covid-19-survey-analysis
This project analyzes publicly available COVID-19 Case Surveillance data from the CDC and demographic data from the US Census Bureau. The aim is to understand the impact of demographics on COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths) and predict the likelihood of death due to COVID-19 using machine learning techniques.
